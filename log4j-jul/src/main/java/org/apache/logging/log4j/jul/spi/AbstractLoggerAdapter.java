/**
 * Abstract Logger registry.
 * <p>
 *     JUL contains methods, such as {@link Logger#setLevel}, which modify the configuration of the logging backend.
 *     To fully implement all {@code Logger} methods, we need to provide a different {@code Logger} implementation
 *     for each Log4j API implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Older Log4j versions provided an alternative {@code CoreLoggerAdapter} implementation that supported
 *     the modification of Log4j Core configuration using JUL.
 * </p>
 *     Since version 2.24.0, however, this implementation was deprecated for removal.
 *     If you wish to enable this feature again, you need to implement this class and provide its FQCN
 *     as {@code log4j.jul.loggerAdapter} configuration property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     <strong>Implementation note:</strong> since version 3.0.0, this interface was moved to a new package.
 * </p>

 * @see <a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2353">Issue #2353</a>
